# Pre-Calculus CPM Chapters 10-13
## About this course
Some MHS teachers have completely given up on the students, refusing to post assignemnts and leaving their pupils weeks behind the average common-core curriculum (that's pretty bad). It is the duty of other students to catch them up and supply them with the learning material they need.
